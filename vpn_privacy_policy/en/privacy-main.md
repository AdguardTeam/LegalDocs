### When you are using our software

When you choose to use our app, you thereby accept to provide us your personal data. This data is essential as it helps ensure the full functionality of AdGuard VPN services.

* Account. When registering, you need to provide your email address and create a password to initially create a VPN connection. We collect this essential data to provide you with the AdGuard VPN service.

* Usage information. It is crucial for a VPN service to understand how much traffic you are using. That is why we collect data about how you interact with our services, how much traffic you’ve used, and for how long have you been using our services.

* Diagnostic/Device information. By default we do not collect anything. But if you give your consent, we collect some anonymized diagnostic information (for crash reports) and some information about the device used to access AdGuard VPN. What exact data we collect, depends on the AdGuard VPN product you are using.

## How We Use Your Personal Data

We follow EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) which defines personal data as:

When we use terms “personal data" or “personal information”, we mean exactly that.
