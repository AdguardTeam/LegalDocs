### When you are using our software

**Sign-in / Account registration**. When signing in to connect the installed app to your account or registering a new account, you need to provide your email address and create a password to initially create a VPN connection. We process this essential data to provide you with the AdGuard VPN service.

**Using our software**. When you choose to use our app, you will provide us your data, including Personal Data. This information, which we must process to ensure the full functionality of AdGuard VPN services, depends on the operating system for which the software is designed. For details, please refer to the corresponding privacy notices.

**Usage information**. When you use our VPN service, we need to make sure that you stay within the agreed-upon limits. Therefore, we collect data on your traffic usage. This is done for two reasons: to prevent misuse of our service and to know when a user's subscription has expired. When the subscription expires or is canceled, the free limit is reactivated and without knowing your previous data usage we cannot properly enforce the rules that limit using the free version.

We store only the number of bytes used by the account, it is not associated with locations. Traffic usage data is stored for 90 days.

Additionally, we collect information on the number of instances of our software that have an active VPN connection for both the free and paid versions. We receive this information from our VPN servers through which you establish a VPN connection.

**Diagnostic / Device information**. However, if you experience problems using our software and you give us your consent, we will collect and process some diagnostic information for crash reports and some information about the device used to run our software in order to help you. The exact information we collect and process depends on the AdGuard VPN software you are using. For details, please refer to the corresponding privacy notices.

### Safeguarding measures

We make every possible effort to protect you and your Personal Data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction. We implement and maintain the following technical and security measures:

**System access controls**: We take reasonable measures to prevent Personal Data from being used without authorization. These controls shall vary based on the nature of the processing undertaken and may include, among other controls, authentication via passwords and/or two-factor authentication, documented authorization processes, documented change management processes and/or logging of access on several levels.

**Data access controls**: We take reasonable measures to ensure that Personal Data is accessible and manageable only by properly authorized staff. Direct database query access is restricted and application access rights are established and enforced to ensure that persons entitled to use a data processing system only have access to the Personal Data to which they have privilege of access; and that personal data cannot be read, copied, modified or removed without authorization in the course of processing.

**Storing data in a data center**: Personal information is stored in our own data center located in Frankfurt. This is secure: the data center does not demand that we collect any data about your traffic or your use of our products and services. If they request us to start doing so, we will stop working with this provider and find an alternative.

**Transmission controls**: We take reasonable measures to ensure that it is possible to check and establish to which entities the transfer of Personal Data by means of data transmission facilities is envisaged so Personal Data cannot be read, copied, modified or removed without authorization during electronic transmission or transport.

**Input controls**: We take reasonable measures to make it possible to check and establish whether and by whom personal data has been entered into data processing systems, modified or removed.

**Data backup**: We regularly back up our databases to protect Personal Data from accidental destruction or loss when hosted by us. The data is also encrypted so that it cannot be used if lost.

**Logical separation**: Personal Data is logically segregated on our systems to ensure that Personal Data collected for different purposes can be processed separately.

### Consequences of not providing your Personal Data

You are not obligated to provide your Personal Data to us. However, as this information is required for us to provide you with our services or respond to your requests, we will not be able to offer our services without it.
