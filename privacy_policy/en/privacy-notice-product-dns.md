## What data is collected and sent by AdGuard DNS

### When AdGuard DNS user tries to visit a page, our server receives following information:

* Userâ€™s IP-address;
* DNS request which contains domain name. 

The DNS request will be forwarded to a root or authoritative DNS server, but for the upstream server it looks as if this request is originated from AdGuard DNS server, there is absolutely no way for them to identify the original user. We, in our turn, do not log or save any of this information.
