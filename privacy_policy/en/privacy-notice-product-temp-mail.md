# AdGuard Temp Mail Privacy Notice

> Keynote: We do not share or sell any of your personal data. We are proud to say that we are one of the fighters for users' privacy and we are strongly committed to this principle and to being as transparent as possible.

This Privacy Notice explains the data we collect and process when you use AdGuard Temp Mail, our temporary email address generator service.

## What data we collect and when

### When you create a mailbox

**The mailbox name.** It is random and generated once when the user starts using the service. It is not associated with any IP address or the user information. We do not collect or store users' IP addresses.
**Timestamps.** We retain the timestamp when each mailbox is created.

### Each time you log in

**Last access time.** We record the time of the last access to each mailbox. We need this information to automatically delete inactive mailboxes.
**Secret cookies.** To facilitate access to the mailbox, a secret cookie is stored on the user's device.

### When you delete your mailbox

**Mailbox deletion time.** The deletion time of mailboxes is stored. Mailboxes can be deleted manually by users or automatically after 7 days of inactivity. The email address is permanently stored and marked as deleted upon removal. The reason for permanently storing the email address is to avoid allocating the same address to a different user.

Upon mailbox deletion, associated emails are physically deleted, and no new emails are accepted.

Even if you donâ€™t delete your mailbox, all mails and related data are permanently deleted 24 hours after receipt.

## Security and data protection

We take data security seriously and have implemented measures to protect your information. Our commitment to your data security includes regular assessments and updates to ensure that your data is safe.

## Changes to this Privacy Notice

Please note that we may update this privacy notice from time to time. If significant changes are made, we will notify users.

If you have any questions or concerns about your privacy or the use of our service, please contact our support team at <support@adguard.com>.

Thank you for choosing AdGuard Temp Mail. Your trust is important to us.
