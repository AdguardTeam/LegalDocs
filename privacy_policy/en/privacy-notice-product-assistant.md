## What data can AdGuard Browser Assistant collect and when

AdGuard Browser Assistant is a companion add-on that extends the functionality of our standalone desktop apps. It does not collect any information by itself, but it communicates with the standalone apps.

### Current page state

Every time you open a new tab, the add-on communicates with the standalone app and requests information about the current page status. In order to do that, it sends the current page's URL to the standalone app.
