## What data is collected and sent by AdGuard for Mac

### License status check

* Hardware ID hash;
* OS language;
* Application identifier;
* Application version;

We use this data to check the license status. MAC and hardware ID hashes are also used to bind the license to the computer. This information is also used to display the user’s license keys in adguard.com personal account.

* Application identifier

### Filter updates check

To check ad blocker filters updates AdGuard connects to its servers. When it happens, nothing is being sent to our server. The application periodically downloads a file with all filters versions and their available updates.

### Sending a message to support

Users can send messages to support right from the app. If they do, a special file containing some information about app settings and OS configuration will be sent. This data is often required to solve potential problems with AdGuard app. User also has an option to include a diagnostic report that contains additional information. Nothing will be sent unless the user manually confirms the submission. 

The following information is included in this report:

* Application identifier;
* Application version;
* OS language;
* OS version;
* Application network settings;
* List of enabled filters.

If the "Include a diagnostic report" option is enabled, the app will also send the contents of the AdGuard log file, which includes various app’s messages (errors, warnings). This information is used for troubleshooting purposes.

### When the app crashes

In case of a malfunction that leads to an unexpected app crash, the user is prompted to send a special crash report. If they agree, we receive following information:

* Unique application ID;
* Unique device ID;
* Device model, its memory size and disk space;
* Application version;
* OS and Kernel versions;
* Stack trace;
* List of components used by the application and their versions;
* OS's last boot timestamp;
* Application's last boot timestamp.

This information is used for further diagnostics and elimination of the problem.

### Browsing security website check

If [“Browsing Security”](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/how-malware-protection-works) option is enabled, AdGuard checks every website before user visits it. We use the Lookup API technology for this purpose, and the information about visited website is sent in form of hash prefixes. This doesn’t allow us to determine which website is being visited.
