# Website & Cookies
*April 09, 2021*
> **Keynote:** We do not share or sell any of your personal data. We are proud to say that we are one of the fighters for users privacy and we are strongly committed to this principle and to being as transparent as possible.

This privacy notice applies to adguard.com and all the AdGuard websites located on its subdomains (“Website”), and describes in detail what information may be collected about you when you visit them.

## Cookies

When you visit our Website, our server will ask your permission to place a small data file called “cookie” on your hard drive. Once you agree, this file is added and helps analyze web traffic. The data we acquire from cookies may be used to:

* Help you log in by remembering your user credentials (depending on which options you select in your profile settings). We may also use cookies to record user registration information. Cookies can help us identify your preferences, including language and currency, for future use.

* Collect anonymous information in order to improve the accuracy of our services. We may also use cookies to collect anonymous information regarding downloads of our products from download site(s); this information is used only for statistical purposes, and no personal data is collected or stored this way.

None of the information we may acquire through the use of cookies is considered Personal Data by the standards of GDPR as it does not allow to identify you as a natural person. You can always [disable cookies](http://www.wikihow.com/Disable-Cookies) on your web browsing software or clear existing cookies. Please note that some features of our products and services may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Interacting With AdGuard Website

### Do Not Track

We respect users' right to keep privacy, and we therefore respect Do Not Track ("DNT") settings in browsers. If you have DNT setting enabled in your browser, all and any analytical tools, including first-party, will not be loaded to the Website.

### IP Address and Basic Device Information

In order to help us deliver content in the correct language, offer region- or country-specific products, and identify your local currency in the event of a purchase, we determine your IP address and acquire basic device information. This information is not stored anywhere, and is anonymous, as we do not know the last digits of your IP address.

### Analytics

We only use analytic tools in order to understand the Website's traffic, and how it is being used by its visitors. The ultimate goal is to improve our services and to grant better experience to users. 

We currently use two website analytic tools. These tools help us understand the use of our site by our visitors by collecting information. 

We consider [Plausible](https://plausible.io) (p.adguard.com) the best option from the privacy point of view as data is not shared with third parties (service providers) and we manage it ourselves. Eventually we will switch over to using only this service.  

In the meantime we also use Google Analytics with enabled [IP address anonymization](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en). Users who wish to not be tracked by Google Analytics can prevent data collection by opting out. To opt out, install [Google Analytics opt-out extension](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

### When You Download AdGuard Products

You are not required to disclose any Personal Data in order to download any of our products.

### When You Purchase AdGuard Products

When you pay for AdGuard products the billing is handled by a third-party service provider. The service provider is acting as our reseller; thus, you will be making your purchase from the service provider directly, and not from AdGuard. The handling of your personal information will be governed by any privacy policy or terms of service published by the service provider.

We save the information you enter on the order page (your email address). This information can be used in the future if you request your license key to be recovered and can be deleted by you from your AdGuard Account. 

The third-party service provider (payment gate) may transmit some of your personal information to us, but not including payment information, unless you specifically agree (as may be the case in the event of a purchase with auto-renewal). We may use the information we receive (not including payment information) to verify your registration or license status, to contact you about the status of your account, or for renewal of your subscription, if applicable.

### When You Use AdGuard Account

[AdGuard Account](https://adguard.com/account/login.html) is a tool which permits you to register multiple licenses under a single account. If you choose to use AdGuard Account you will be asked to provide your email address. You will also be asked to select a password. We may use this information for purposes of validating your license, providing support, delivering additional products and services, and enabling you to change your AdGuard Account and/or product settings. By registering AdGuard Account you confirm that you are at least 16 years old.

### Links To Other Websites 

Our Website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide while visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement.
