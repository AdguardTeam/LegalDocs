## What we collect when you use AdGuard for Android

### License check
AdGuard connects to its servers to validate your license status. When it happens, the following information is sent:
* Application identifier.
* Application version.
* Device name (which includes both device manufacturer name and device model name).
* Device IP address.
* Your license key.
* Amazon purchase ID (if any).

### Ad Blocker filters updates check
AdGuard connects to its servers to check ad blocker filters updates. When it happens, the following information is sent:
* Ad blocking filters identifiers.
* Current ad blocker filters versions.

### Browsing Security site check
If you enable “Phishing and malware protection” option, AdGuard application checks every web site before you visit it. We use Lookup API technology for this purpose, and the information about visited website is sent in form of hash prefixes. This doesn’t allow us to determine which website is being visited.

When browsing security is enabled, AdGuard periodically does a latency check for the list of browsing security servers; no information is being sent in these requests, though.

### Browsing Security community
If you enable the “Help us in Browsing Security development” setting, the program will periodically send anonymous security-related data:
* URLs of visited websites that AdGuard identifies as potentially untrustworthy (access to which are blocked by the “Browsing Security” module).
* Information on the nature of identified threats.

The information described above, when collected by the AdGuard for Android, is generally not correlated with any other personal information related to you and is used anonymously in aggregation with similar information from other users of the AdGuard software for analytical purposes.

### Send feedback
When you contact the support service via the “Send Feedback” section, the following information is sent along with your message and the email you’ve entered:
* Application identifier.
* Application version.
* Device name (which includes both device manufacturer name and device model name).
* Android version.
* Android kernel version.
* The list of enabled Ad Blocker filters.
* Configuration of your application.

If you enabled the “Send system report” option, the program will also send additional data for the troubleshooting:

* A list of application threads and their stack traces.
* Log file contents.
* A list of installed applications.
