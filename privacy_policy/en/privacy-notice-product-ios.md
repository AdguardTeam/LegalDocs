## What data is collected and sent by AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS

### Safari Content Blocker blocking filters updates check

To check for Safari Content Blocker blocking filters updates AdGuard connects to its servers. When it happens, the following information is being sent:

* Application language;
* Application identifier.

Filter updates check is performed once a day. We do not store the obtained data, but we do aggregate it in order to identify the total number of active users.

### Sending a bug report

AdGuard users can report bugs by clicking “Send bug report” button in the app menu. When it happens, the following information is being sent along with the message text and the entered email:

* Log file contents;
* Application identifier;
* `.json` file created by the app that contains rules for Safari;
* A list of the enabled blocking filters;
* Application and OS versions;
* Device model;
* Chosen Locale and Region.

In AdGuard Pro case we also receive:

* Active blocking subscriptions list;
* VPN tunnel log.

This data is used for further diagnostics and troubleshooting.

### Sending a web page complaint

User can submit a report on a problem with a website right from the app. The app will automatically open reports.adguard.com web page and forward some information about its configuration. User can then alter or delete it.

Unless user agrees to submit this information by manually clicking the “Submit” button, none of this information will be saved or sent anywhere. In case they do, the report will become public (but anonymous) on [GitHub](https://github.com/adguardteam/adguardfilters/issues).
