## What data is collected and sent by AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS

AdGuard and AdGuard Pro for iOS both establish a local VPN, there is no remote connection to any server. Apps do not collect any data, therefore they do not share anything with third parties.

### Safari Content Blocker blocking filters updates check

To check for Safari Content Blocker blocking filters updates AdGuard connects to its servers. When it happens, the following information is being sent:

* Application language;
* Application identifier.

Filter updates check is performed once a day. We do not store the obtained data, but we do aggregate it in order to identify the total number of active users.

AdGuard users can report bugs by clicking “Send bug report” button in the app menu. When it happens, the following information is being sent along with the message text and the entered email:
