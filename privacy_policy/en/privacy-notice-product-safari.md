## What data can AdGuard for Safari collect and when

* [Blocking filters updates check](#filters-updates-check)
* [Sending a web page complaint](#web-page-complaint)

### <a id="filters-updates-check"></a> Blocking filters updates check

To check filter updates AdGuard connects to its servers. When it happens, the following information is being sent:

* Safari language;
* Client ID (a random number generated on AdGuard for Safari installation);
* AdGuard for Safari version;
* AdGuard for Safari build type.

By default, check for filters updates is performed automatically every 48 hours. Otherwise, it's performed according to the selected filter updates check interval, or whenever is requested manually by User. We aggregate the data obtained this way in order to identify the number of active users.

### <a id="web-page-complaint"></a> Sending a web page complaint

User can submit a report on a problem with a website right from AdGuard for Safari. The app will automatically open reports.adguard.com web page and forward some information about its configuration. User can then alter or delete it.

Unless User agrees to submit this information by manually clicking the "Submit" button, none of this information will be saved or sent anywhere. In case they do, the report will be published anonymously on [GitHub](https://github.com/adguardteam/adguardfilters/issues).
