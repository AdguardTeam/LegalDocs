# Adguard Privacy Policy
*August 03, 2017*

> **Keynote:** Adguard does not share/sell any of your personal data. We are proud to say that we are one of the fighters for users privacy and we are strongly committed to this principle and to being as transparent as possible.

Our privacy policy lists the information that is collected and the processing applied to it. All the info collected includes no more than is crucial to provide full functionality of Adguard products, and is never shared with any third parties. We do not collect anything for tracking purposes and take all necessary technical, administrative and physical measures to protect the information we get.

Please read our privacy policy to learn what kind of information we collect via Adguard products and how we store and use it afterwards.

## What we consider as “personal information”

Personal information or Personally identifiable information is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. 

Any other information (that does not identify you in any way) is considered as non-personal.

Our general principle is to collect only the information that is necessary to provide you with full functionality of our products and for licensing. And we never share any of your data with third-parties.

## How do we get information about you?

There are several ways how we may get your data:

* When you give us the information directly (when you yourself contact us or send us bug report, or subscribe to our blog, forum, newsletter and etc).
* When you are using our products, information is automatically collected. It occurs when you are updating programs, contact support services and so on. You can find the full list of data collected on a Privacy Notice page dedicated to the product you use.
* When you visit our website, there are cookies and metrics that give us information about you. Learn more about the data collected and how you can manage that on the [Adguard websites’ privacy notice](https://adguard.com/privacy-websites.html). 

## Storage, Retention, and Deletion of Personal Information

**Storage**
Personally identifiable information on our servers is only accessible from our physical premises, or via an encrypted virtual private network (VPN). Access is limited to authorized personnel only, and company networks are password protected, and subject to additional policies and procedures for security.

**Deletion of user’s information**
In general, our policy is to keep user’s information for no longer than reasonably necessary in light of the purpose for which the information was collected, plus any additional period that is permitted or required by law thereafter. Following the expiration of the purpose for which we collected personal information plus any additional period that is permitted or required by law, we will either delete or de-identify the information from our systems.

## Information Security
Under no circumstances shall we disclose the information we collect about users to a third party (except when required by law or if we obtain your permission).

Data we collect is stored on specially protected servers. Access is restricted to a limited number of authorized persons who need the access in order to administer our websites or ensure their proper functionality, especially with regard to technical support.

If you have a disagreement with us relating to our handling of your data, we ask that you contact us to work it out. We are always happy to hear from you, and we promise to try our best to respond to any concerns you may have.

## Can Adguard change its Privacy Policy?
Time goes by, and and it is quite possible that we will have to add changes to the current Privacy Policy. But don’t worry, all the updates will be available on GitHub and announced through blog posts, forum threads. Being transparent to the fullest when it comes to privacy is our main goal.
