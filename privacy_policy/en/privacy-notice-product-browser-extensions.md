### Adguard extension installation
Adguard extension connects to its server just after installation or update. When it happens, the following information is sent:
* Unique extension ID.
* Extension version.
* Browser language.
* «Show acceptable ads» setting value.

We do this with a single purpose: to know the number of unique installations of our extension. This information is stored for 24 hours and then it is deleted.

Also Adguard makes a request to our server in order to get user's country code. The only purpose of this is to enable proper language-specific filter.

### Ad Blocker filters updates check
Adguard extension connects to its servers to check ad blocker filters updates. When it happens, the following information is sent:
* Ad blocker filters identifiers.
* Current ad blocker filters versions.
* Browser extension type.
* Extension version.

### Browsing Security site check
If you enable «Phishing and malware protection» option, Adguard extension checks every web site before you visit it. We use Lookup API technology for this purpose, and the information about visited website is sent in form of hash prefixes. This doesn’t allow us to determine which website is being visited.
 
### Statistics for ad filters usage

* The list is created based on the website's visit statistics since the last time statistical data was sent.

By gathering statistics on used filtering rules, we can detect and remove the rules that are no longer used. As a result, it will help all those who use Adguard.
