# Privacy Policy of AdGuard Wallet (the “Privacy Policy”)

*November 25, 2025*

**Keynote:** We are proud to say that we fight for users’ privacy, and we are strongly committed to this principle and to being as transparent as possible. We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right. That is why we are transparent about what AdGuard Wallet does and explain the purpose of every bit of technical data that may be processed locally on your device or through optional interactions. This Privacy Policy applies when you interact with our AdGuard Wallet App, as defined below.

This Privacy Policy is applicable between you as a user of our App and us as the operator of the App. It applies to the use of any Personal Data we collect or that you provide to us in connection with your use of the AdGuard Wallet App.

By using the AdGuard Wallet App, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.

## Who We Are

**ADGUARD WALLET LTD** (**“AdGuard”,** **“we”,** **“us”,** **“our”**) is a company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Cyprus, under Registration Number ΗΕ 476642, with its registered office at **Anexartisias & Athinon, NORA COURT, 2nd floor, Flat/Office 203–205, 3040, Limassol, Cyprus**.

We act as the data controller when processing your data, where applicable. This Privacy Policy explains how, why, and when we process limited technical data, and outlines your rights, including how you can contact us if you have any questions or concerns. Our general principle is to minimize data collection and avoid personal data processing wherever possible.

This Privacy Policy applies to the use of the AdGuard Wallet application (the **“AdGuard Wallet App”**). It does **not** apply to third-party websites or services linked within the AdGuard Wallet App. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of those services separately.

If you have any questions, please contact us at privacy@adguard.com.

## Definitions

In this Privacy Policy:

**Personal Data** means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

**Sensitive Personal Information** means Personal Data that reveals a user's social security, driver's license, state identification card, or passport number; account log-in, financial account, debit card, or credit card number in combination with any required security or access code, password, or credentials allowing access to an account; precise geolocation; racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, or union membership; contents of mail, email, and text messages unless we are the intended recipient of the communication; genetic data; and the processing of biometric information for the purpose of uniquely identifying a user.

**Services** primarily means the AdGuard Wallet App.

**Data Controller** means the natural or legal person who (alone or jointly with others) determines the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Data. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, AdGuard is the Data Controller of your Personal Data.

## What Data We Do Not Collect or Process

We do **not** collect or process the following data:

- Your name, email, or address
- Your network metadata
- Any wallet private keys or stored assets
- Any in-app user activity or behavior data
- Any device identifiers, cookies, or tracking pixels
- Any analytics data through third-party SDKs or services

We do not collect or process Sensitive Personal Information.

**All communications with blockchain networks and APIs occur directly from your device.**

**If users wish to further limit the collection of their device and usage information, users could consider the use of virtual private networks, or ‘VPNs’.**

## What Data We May Process Locally on Your Device

Certain data is processed **only locally** on your device to provide the functionality of the AdGuard Wallet App:

- Public wallet addresses
- Transaction history
- Token balances

To provide up-to-date information, the AdGuard Wallet App may connect directly to public blockchain nodes or third-party APIs (e.g., price aggregators). This communication is not relayed or monitored by us in any way.

## Tracking of External Links

When you click on external links within the AdGuard Wallet App, the request may be routed through a **Traffic Distribution System (TDS)** for performance tracking or link redirection management.
During this process, we may collect **non-identifiable technical data**, including:

- Timestamp of the click
- App version
- Country (based on device locale)

We may temporarily process IP addresses, only where necessary and to provide the best possible experience for AdGuard users. This includes the following purposes:

- to comply with our legal obligations (e.g., to help us avoid providing services to regions prohibited by sanctions laws);
- to ensure the safety, security and integrity of the Services (e.g., for the prevention of DDoS attacks).

## Optional Diagnostic Services

If you choose to enable features like in-app support or bug reporting, we may request your permission to send minimal diagnostic data, which may include:

- App version and operating system
- Optional user message or error description

This information is submitted only with your explicit consent and is used exclusively to resolve technical issues. It is never shared with any third parties.

Our data collection practices are limited to information essential for Services delivery. As per above, the specific types of Personal Data we may handle include both user-provided data and automatically gathered information. For AdGuard users, this encompasses:

- **Wallet Data Handling:** We temporarily process wallet addresses during API interactions to support essential app functionality. This occurs when AdGuard is used with default settings, which you are free to customize or disable at any time.
- **User Preference Settings:** Your chosen preferences and configuration details are processed strictly to deliver our services. This data is generally stored locally on your device. If synchronization across devices is enabled, the data is encrypted in such a way that only your approved devices can decrypt it.
- **Optional Feedback Submissions:** We only collect comments, feedback, or survey answers if you willingly decide to provide them.
Analytics and Usage Metrics: With your permission (through MetaMetrics), we collect data about how you use the AdGuard Wallet App to help improve its features. This information is pseudonymized and not connected to any personally identifiable data unless you explicitly request otherwise. You may turn off this feature at any time.
- **Device Identifier Data:** If you activate wallet notifications, we collect device-specific identifiers required for sending push notifications. These identifiers are stored only as long as notification preferences remain active, and the feature can be disabled whenever you choose.

Firstly, please note that we do not collect Personal Data by default, only when needed or when submitted by you. If you submit diagnostic data through optional features, you may request its deletion by contacting us at privacy@adguard-wallet.com.

Your rights associated with the Services are described below.

Please note these rights may only be available to you in specific regions, countries or states based on where you reside.

Depending on Your location (especially if you are in the EU, or U.S.A.), you have certain data protection rights. AdGuard aims to take reasonable steps to allow you to exercise these rights:

- **Right to Access or Right to Know.** You have the right to obtain access to the Personal Data we hold about you and to request certain information about our processing. You have the right to receive an explanation of (i) why we process your Personal Data, (ii) the categories of Personal Data we have about you, (iii) who we share your Personal Data with, (iv) how long we store your Personal Data and (v) who we received your Personal Data from if it was not collected from you directly. We will also inform you about your privacy rights. We will notify you where we engage in automated decision making.
- **Right to Rectification or Correction.** You have the right to correct, update or complete any Personal Data we hold about you that is inaccurate or incomplete. Please note that we may rectify or remove incomplete or inaccurate information, at any time and at our own discretion.
- **Right to Erasure or Deletion.** You may request to have your Personal Data anonymized, erased, or deleted, as appropriate. In this case, if there is no overriding legitimate interest or requirement to continue processing your Personal Data, we will erase your data.
- **Right to Object to Processing.** You have the right to object to our processing of your Personal Data where we are relying on a legitimate interest or if we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes.
- **Right to Restrict Processing.** You have a right in certain circumstances to stop us processing your Personal Data other than for storage purposes.
- **Right to Withdraw Consent.** You may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us regarding the processing of your Personal Data at any time and free of charge. We will apply your preferences going forward. This will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before you withdraw your consent.
- **Right to Data Portability.** You may request transfer of your data to you or another Data Controller in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, under certain conditions.
- **Right to Lodge a Complaint.** You may lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, including in your country of residence, place of work, or where you believe an incident took place.
- **Right Against Discrimination.** We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights.

We will respond within the timeframes required by applicable law (typically one month under GDPR or if you submit a request under CPRA within 45 days).

## Data Transfers

We do not store or transfer any personal data. No international data transfers are applicable. Should we introduce server-side features in the future, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly.

## Legal Basis

Our data practices are aligned with the following legal frameworks:

- Applicable data protection laws of the **Republic of Cyprus**
- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** (Regulation (EU) 2016/679)
- **California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)**

We process data only when legally permitted, and always under the principle of data minimization. We do not sell or rent your Personal Data.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. In the event of changes, users will be notified through the AdGuard Wallet App interface. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
