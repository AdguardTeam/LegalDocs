## 1. General

1.1. AdGuard Software Limited provides AdGuard Mail (“Software”), which is an email forwarding and temporary email application available across platforms, including web-based access. You are solely and exclusively responsible for the use of AdGuard Mail. AdGuard Software Limited shall not be liable for any loss, whether monetary or non-monetary, including but not limited to attorney fees or court costs, regardless of any laws or statutes that might suggest otherwise.

1.2. AdGuard Software Limited grants you a non-exclusive and limited license to download and use AdGuard Mail within the scope of the functionality described on the Website, provided that you comply with all requirements, restrictions, and terms specified in this EULA. The AdGuard Mail application and services are owned and copyrighted by AdGuard Software Limited and are protected worldwide. AdGuard Software Limited retains all rights, title, and interest in and to the AdGuard Mail application and services and any portion thereof, including, without limitation, all copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights. All rights are reserved unless otherwise noted. Modifying, distributing to unauthorized parties, reverse engineering, or otherwise using AdGuard Mail in any way not expressly authorized by AdGuard Software Limited with written consent or permitted by this EULA is strictly prohibited.

1.3. If you have received, downloaded, and/or installed a beta version of AdGuard Mail, as identified by AdGuard Software Limited, AdGuard Software Limited hereby grants you a non-exclusive license to use the beta version of AdGuard Mail solely for testing purposes and only during the applicable testing period. This license is contingent upon your participation in the Beta testing program of AdGuard Software Limited and your compliance with all rules of the Beta testing program, as well as with all requirements, restrictions, and terms specified in this EULA. Any use of the beta version of AdGuard Mail for purposes other than testing or beyond the applicable testing period is strictly prohibited.

1.4. AdGuard Mail, which AdGuard Software Limited may provide on a free basis in accordance with Section 1.2, may have a number of limitations, such as restrictions on the number of email aliases you can create and the number of recipients you can forward emails to. Information on these and other limitations is provided on the Website.

1.5. To use AdGuard Mail, you must install the Application or visit the Website and log in using your email address or sign up by creating a new account. You must provide a valid email address when signing up. You may also log in with an email and password that you have previously registered on the Website or other Rightholder’s websites, such as adguard.com.

1.6. We may modify or discontinue AdGuard Mail free services and benefits without notice at any time at our sole discretion.

1.7. Your continued use of AdGuard Mail after any modifications to this EULA have been made will constitute your acceptance of such modifications.

## 2. Terms of sale

2.1. Customer pays for a subscription that allows activating AdGuard Mail, a piece of software downloadable from [adguard-mail.com](https://adguard-mail.com). In order to use the paid version of AdGuard Mail, you need to purchase a monthly or one-year subscription. Once you purchase a subscription, it is automatically linked to your Account. You don’t need to activate the Software: it becomes active as soon as you purchase it. The period of use of AdGuard Mail granted by the Rightholder is specified when you purchase the subscription. The term of use of AdGuard Mail starts from the purchase of the subscription. If the term of use of AdGuard Mail starts at a different time, this information will be provided when you purchase the subscription.

2.2. Purchases of subscriptions for the Software from Rightholder’s website are governed by separate Terms of Sale, which are expressly incorporated by reference into this EULA. Purchases of subscriptions for the Software from Rightholder’s Partners may be subject to additional terms and conditions of sale provided by such Partners.

2.3. You are entitled to a refund in accordance with the Terms of Sale.

2.4. You can cancel the purchased subscription at any time in accordance with the Terms of Sale. The canceled subscription will be valid until its expiry date.

2.5. You can cancel the automatic subscription renewal at any time in accordance with the Terms of Sale.

2.6. You can extend the subscription term up to another month, year, or two by purchasing another subscription. If you have a monthly subscription and buy a 1-year subscription, you’ll be switched to annual billing — and vice versa.

2.7. You can transfer the purchased subscription to another Account. To do this, contact our support team at [support@adguard-vpn.com](mailto:support@adguard-vpn.com).

2.8. When you purchase an AdGuard Mail subscription, an AdGuard Account is automatically created for the email address that you used at the purchase. AdGuard Account can also be registered after the installation of the Software or directly via the Website. By registering the Account, you affirm that you are 18 years or older.

If desired, you can delete the Account in the *Settings* section. The active subscription will be cancelled. In this case, you can ask for a refund if you bought a 1-year subscription no more than 30 days ago. To get a refund, you’ll need to contact our support team at [support@adguard-mail.com](mailto:support@adguard-mail.com).

Note that when your Account is created you are automatically subscribed to notifications about modifications, new versions, and features of the Software. You can unsubscribe at any time.

2.9. The Rightholder reserves the right to use any means and procedures to verify the validity of the subscription and/or legality of a copy of the Software installed and/or used on your device.

## 3. Refund policy

We grant our customers an opportunity to get a 100% refund on the funds they spent on one-year and AdGuard Mail subscriptions purchased through [adguard-mail.com](https://adguard-mail.com) (for subscriptions purchased elsewhere, check the refund policy of the particular reseller).

---

**Important**: monthly subscriptions are non-refundable. One-year subscriptions have a 30-day money-back guarantee. All refund requests made within 30 days of the purchase of a 1-year subscription are granted regardless of the reason.

---

The subscription in question becomes blocked at the moment the refund is issued. After 30 days, all refund requests are reviewed individually, and the decision to issue a refund rests with Adguard Software Ltd. We do not grant partial refunds for subscription upgrades or renewals. Each partial refund request is discussed separately between the Customer and Support and is granted only upon mutual agreement. To get a refund for a subscription purchased through the Website, contact the support team: [support@adguard-mail.com](mailto:support@adguard-mail.com). Processing time depends on your choice of payment method and usually takes up to 10 business days.
