This Privacy Notice applies to adguard.com and all the AdGuard websites located on its subdomains (“Website”), and describes in detail what information may be collected about you when you visit them.

## Cookies

When you visit our Website, our server will ask your permission to place a small data file called “cookie” on your hard drive. Once you agree, this file is added and helps analyze web traffic. The data we acquire from cookies may be used to:

- Help you log in by remembering your user credentials (depending on the options you select in your profile settings). We may also use cookies to record user registration information. Cookies can help us identify your preferences, including language and currency, for future use.

- Collect anonymous information in order to improve the accuracy of our services. We may also use cookies to collect anonymous information regarding downloads of our products from download site(s). This information is used for statistical purposes only and no personal data is collected or stored this way.

None of the information we may acquire through the use of cookies is considered personal data by the standards of GDPR as it does not allow us to identify you as a natural person. You can always [disable cookies](http://www.wikihow.com/Disable-Cookies) on your web browsing software or clear existing cookies. Please note that some features of our products and services may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Do Not Track

We respect users’ right to privacy and therefore respect Do Not Track (“DNT”) settings in browsers. If you have DNT settings enabled in your browser, any and all analytical tools, including first-party tools, will not be loaded on the Website. We also comply with the Global Privacy Control specification, so we don't store information about the websites you visit.

### IP address and basic device information

In order to help us deliver content in the correct language, offer region- or country-specific products, and identify your local currency when you make a purchase, we determine your IP address and acquire basic device information. This information is not stored anywhere.

### Analytics

We only use analytic tools in order to understand the Website’s traffic, and how it is being used by its visitors. The ultimate goal is to improve our services, Website’s performance, and generally provide a better experience for our users.

We do not use any JavaScript-based tracking or cookies. Instead, we use our server logs (i.e. information about what pages were requested) to measure how people use our website. Raw server logs, including anonymized IP addresses, are aggregated to create general reports for us and are retained for 90 days and then deleted.

### When downloading AdGuard products

You are not required to disclose any personal data in order to download any of our products.

### When purchasing AdGuard products

When you pay for AdGuard products, the billing is handled by a third-party service provider. The service provider acts as our reseller; therefore, you make your purchase directly from the service provider and not from AdGuard. The handling of your personal information will be governed by any privacy policy or terms of service published by the service provider.

We store the information you enter on the order page (your email address). This information can be used in the future if you request a license key recovery. You can also delete it from your AdGuard account.

The third-party service provider (payment gate) may transmit some of your personal information to us, but not including payment information, unless you specifically consent (as may be the case with an auto-renewal purchase). We may use the information we receive (not including payment information) to verify your registration or license status, to contact you regarding the status of your account, or to renew your subscription, if applicable.

### When using an AdGuard account

[AdGuard account](https://auth.adguard.com/login.html) is a tool that allows users to manage their licenses, purchases, and billing settings. When you create an AdGuard account, you will be asked to provide your email address. You will also be asked to create a password. We may use this information to validate your license, provide support, deliver additional products and services, and allow you to change your AdGuard account and/or product settings. By registering an AdGuard account, you confirm that you are at least 16 years old.

The exact list of data processed by AdGuard to ensure the operation of the AdGuard account includes:

- Email address
- Sign-up date
- Subscriptions and licenses
- ASN (autonomous system number). We do not store your IP address, only your ASN. ASN identifies your ISP but not you
- City and country of your IP address when you try to log in to the service

**Why we need this information:** The email address serves as an account identifier and is also needed to communicate with the user.  We need to know the ASN, city and country so that we can tailor our service to your specific needs. It's also security related: With this information, we can see from where someone is trying to log in to an account using your email, and prevent or notify you of “suspicious” logins.

### Links to other websites

Our Website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide while visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this Privacy Notice. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy policy applicable to the website in question.

### News subscriptions

Our Website offers news and information on a subscription basis including newsletters, blogs, or other information. If you subscribe to any of these services you may be asked to provide your email address. By subscribing, you confirm that you are at least 16 years old.
You can unsubscribe from our newsletters via AdGuard account or by clicking the “Unsubscribe” button in the newsletter itself.

### Additional registration on AdGuard Website

On some subdomains of the Website, you may have the option to complete additional registration, which may require you to select a username and password, provide your physical location, and provide an email address. By registering for any of the services provided on the AdGuard Website, you confirm that you are at least 16 years old. All information collected in this manner will be stored and used in accordance with the [Privacy Policy](https://adguard.com/privacy.html) and can be corrected or deleted upon your request. To make such a request, please send a message to <privacy@adguard.com>. We may ask you to verify your identity before fulfilling your request.
