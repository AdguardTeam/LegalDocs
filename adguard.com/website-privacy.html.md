Our general principle is to collect only the information that is necessary to provide you with full functionality of our products and services. We strictly follow the principle of “minimization” when processing your data.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites or services that you visit, even if the Websites, the AdGuard Account, or the Affiliate Account have links to such third-party websites or services. You should familiarize yourself with privacy policies of third-party websites and services.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or if you want to exercise any of your rights, please contact us at [privacy@adguard.com](mailto:privacy@adguard.com).

PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY THOROUGHLY.

IF YOU AGREE AND ACCEPT THIS PRIVACY POLICY, WE WILL PROCESS YOUR DATA STATED BELOW FOR THE DECLARED PROCESSING PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH OUR POLICIES AND PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT VISIT OR USE THE WEBSITES, THE ADGUARD ACCOUNT, OR THE AFFILIATE ACCOUNT, AND DO NOT PROVIDE YOUR INFORMATION TO US.

## What data we process

We process different data depending on the situation. You can learn details about what data we process in this section.

Some data that we receive and process may be treated as personal data (“Personal Data”) in accordance with the laws of certain territories and countries. When we use terms “personal data” or “personal information”, we mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, excluding any anonymized and depersonalized data where your identity is absent or has been removed and cannot be recovered.

When you visit the Websites, the AdGuard Account, or the Affiliate Account and their subdomains, we process the following information obtained by our web server to provide you with the content you request: IP addresses in anonymized form, timestamp of the server request, type and version of your web browser, name and version of your operating system, requesting domain (URL), address of the previously visited page (referrer URL), host name.

### When you visit the Websites

You can visit and use the Websites for informational purposes without having to provide any personal data. However, to provide you with certain functionality of our Websites listed below, we need to process some of your personal data. Without such processing, we will not be able to provide you with such functionality of our Websites.

**Sending messages.** We may use your email address to communicate with you when we need to make announcements, inform you of updates and new features in our software or services, provide you with advice, and communicate with you when you report errors.

You may also give us your consent to process your email to send you marketing messages about other AdGuard software or services. You may withdraw your consent at any time by unsubscribing from our newsletter via the AdGuard Account or by clicking the “Unsubscribe” button or link in the email itself.

**Buying a license.** We process your email address for billing and payment purposes. If you buy a subscription to AdGuard software, we’ll use the email address you provide to send you information about the purchase, such as your subscription status and renewal notifications (if applicable), and to recover your license key if you request it.

We conduct all transactions via two payment providers — [Paddle.com Inc.](https://www.paddle.com) and [PayPro Global](https://payproglobal.com) — to process payments when you purchase a subscription to use our software and services. Processed data: your email address, country of residence, zip/postal code, and if you use a bank card to make a purchase, the card number, name, expiration date and the security code associated with the bank card. Paddle privacy policy: [www.paddle.com/legal/privacy](https://www.paddle.com/legal/privacy). PayPro Global privacy policy: [docs.payproglobal.com/documents/legal/privacyPolicy.pdf](https://docs.payproglobal.com/documents/legal/privacyPolicy.pdf)

The third-party service provider may transmit some of your personal data to us, but not including payment information, unless you specifically agree (as may be the case if you purchase a subscription with auto-renewal). We may use the information to verify your registration or subscription status, or for renewal of your subscription, if applicable.

### When you use the AdGuard Account

To use our AdGuard Account, you need to register your account and sign in.

**Registering your account.** We process your email address and a hash of the password you use for authorization. That ensures that you can retrieve your password if needed.

If you choose to register your account using your third-party account, such as a Google, Apple, or Facebook account, we will process an authentication token to prove your identity. AdGuard does not request or have access to your third-party accounts.

**Sending messages.** To keep you informed about the operation and new features of the AdGuard Account, we will process your email address.

To receive newsletters and promotional emails about the AdGuard software, you can opt-in and subscribe to the newsletters. You can withdraw your consent at any time by unsubscribing in your account settings or by clicking on the appropriate link in the email you receive.

Data processing during the use of the AdGuard software as well as the sections of the AdGuard Account related to the AdGuard software is governed by the privacy policies of the respective software.

### When you use the Affiliate Account

To use our Affiliate Account, you need to register your account and sign in.

**Registering your account.** We process your username, email address, and a hash of the password you use for authorization.

**Processing your payouts.** To process payments via the payout method you have chosen, we will process the email address you indicate as an account identifier of a third-party payment service to which you want to receive your payouts.

We conduct all transactions via third-party payment providers. To process payments via the payout method you have chosen, we will share some of your personal data with a third party payment service to which you want to receive your payouts.

**Sending messages.** To keep you informed about the Affiliate Account and the AdGuard affiliate program, we will process your email address.
