## What data AdGuard Mini for Mac (formerly AdGuard for Safari) can collect and when

Here we describe all cases when and what data is sent to our server, so you can be sure that we only collect the minimum necessary for the application to work properly. The information we collect about you depends on how you interact with our application.

### Technical and interaction data

Upon first launch, users are asked if they consent to send technical and interaction data, disabled by default. If they agree, the following anonymized data is sent:

- App configuration (version, enabled features, etc.)
- Device information (brand name, type, OS, language, etc.)
- User interactions (names of visited screens and events like button clicks, etc.)

Submitting this information is optional. If you choose not to consent, no data will be transmitted. You may withdraw your consent at any time.

When the data is sent to AdGuard, your IP address may be temporarily collected as part of our server logs.

This data is used only internally and is not shared with third parties.

**Why we need this information:**

- To find out which features are used the most
- To find issues that one may face while using the app
- To fix mistakes in the UI/UX
- To learn what people like or don’t like about our app

### Checking for filter updates

To check for filter updates, AdGuard connects to its servers. When it happens, the following information is sent:

- Browser language
- App identifier
- Version of the extension

By default, filter updates are automatically checked every 48 hours. Otherwise, it’s done according to the selected interval, or whenever it’s manually requested by a user. We do not store this data, but we do aggregate it in an anonymous form to count the total number of active users.

### Sending a web page complaint

The user can submit a report of a website problem directly from AdGuard Mini for Mac. The app will automatically open the [reports.adguard.com](https://reports.adguard.com/new_issue.html) web page and forward some information about its configuration. The user can then alter or delete it.
Unless the user agrees to submit this information by manually clicking the “Submit” button, none of this information is stored or sent anywhere. If the user agrees, the report will become public (but anonymous) on [GitHub](https://github.com/adguardteam/adguardfilters/issues).
