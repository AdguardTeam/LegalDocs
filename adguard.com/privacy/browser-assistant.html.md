## What data AdGuard Browser Assistant can collect and when

AdGuard Browser Assistant is a companion add-on that extends the functionality of our standalone desktop apps. It does not collect any information by itself, but it communicates with the standalone apps. To find out what data AdGuard Ad Blocker collects, please refer to the respective Privacy Notices for [AdGuard for Mac](https://adguard.com/privacy/mac.html) and [AdGuard for Windows](https://adguard.com/privacy/windows.html).

### Launching for the first time

When AdGuard Browser Assistant is first launched, the following information is sent to the standalone app:

- User-Agent

- Version

### Current page state

Every time a user opens a new tab, the add-on communicates with the standalone app and requests information about the current page status. To do this, it sends the URL of the current page to the standalone app.

### Sending a web page complaint

The user can submit a report of a website problem directly from AdGuard Browser Assistant. The app will automatically open the [reports.adguard.com](https://reports.adguard.com/new_issue.html) web page and forward some information about its configuration. The user can then alter or delete it.
Unless the user agrees to submit this information by manually clicking the “Submit” button, none of this information is stored or sent anywhere. If the user agrees, the report will become public (but anonymous) on [GitHub](https://github.com/adguardteam/adguardfilters/issues).
