# AdGuard DNS Privacy Policy
*July 21, 2022*

> Keynote: We do not share or sell any of your personal data. We are proud to say that we fight for users' privacy and we are strongly committed to this principle and to being as transparent as possible.

We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right. That's why we are transparent about what AdGuard does, and explain the purpose of every little bit of information that may be gathered by our apps and services.

Below we list all the information that we may collect via AdGuard DNS and explain why we do it and how we use this information. The information we collect includes no more than is crucial to provide the full functionality of AdGuard DNS, both public and private. We do not collect anything for tracking purposes and take all necessary measures to protect the information we get.

## Who We Are

ADGUARD SOFTWARE LIMITED (“We”, “Our” or “Us”) collects and processes your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and in compliance with the applicable data protection laws. This Policy provides you with the necessary information regarding your rights and our obligations and explains how, why and when we process your personal data. Our general principle is to collect only the information that is necessary to provide you with full functionality of our products and services.

## What We Do
AdGuard DNS operates as a DNS resolver which can block access to certain domains, depending on the chosen configuration (server):

AdGuard DNS Default blocks access to domains that we consider ad, tracking, or malware. This list is constantly updated based on the community feedback.

AdGuard DNS Family blocks access to the same domains as Default, and also to domains that may contain adult content. It also enforces safe search and other safe modes wherever possible, which can result in modified search results, missing comment sections, and other differences in web page appearance compared to its original state.

Non-filtering AdGuard DNS doesn't block or redirect anything. It only returns the IP address of the requested domain.

Private AdGuard DNS blocks DNS queries or modifies DNS responses in accordance with the user’s preferences. In addition to that, it displays the queries and statistics to the user via the AdGuard DNS dashboard. Registering an AdGuard account is required to use this type of DNS resolver.

Whenever an AdGuard DNS server (except non-filtering servers) receives a request to a domain that’s considered to be an ad or tracking domain, it returns an “unspecified IP” response (0.0.0.0). Whenever an AdGuard DNS server (except non-filtering servers) receives a request to a domain that’s considered to be a malware domain, or when an AdGuard DNS Family server receives a request to a domain that’s considered to be an adult domain, it replies with a redirect to a dummy page that explains what has happened.

If you disagree with us about classifying a certain domain as advertising, tracking, malicious, or adult one, or if you believe a certain domain should get blocked by one of AdGuard DNS servers, contact us at support@adguard.com.
## What Data AdGuard DNS Can Collect And When

We do not collect anything about the user specifically. In other words, your IP address or any data about you is not logged.

We store aggregated performance metrics of our DNS server, namely the number of complete requests to a particular server, the number of blocked requests, and the speed of processing requests.

We keep and store the anonymous database of domains requested in the last 24 hours. There is no information whatsoever that could link any of these domain names to the original user who sent the request. We need this information to identify and block new trackers and threats.

We also log how many times this or that tracker has been blocked. We need this information to remove outdated rules from our filters.

All data that we collect is not shared with any third parties. It is used solely for internal purposes such as performance analytics. The only information that we can possibly share is derivatives, i.e. lists of domains that our servers recognized as advertising, tracking, or malicious.
