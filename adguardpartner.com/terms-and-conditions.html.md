These Terms contain the complete agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, whether oral or written. AdGuard’s failure to exercise or delay in exercising any of its rights under these Terms or upon any breach of these Terms shall not be deemed a waiver of those rights or of the breach.

### (3) Restriction on amendments

No AdGuard affiliate, or agent or employee of an AdGuard affiliate, is authorized to make any amendment to these Terms. Any conflict or ambiguity between these Terms and any separate terms or conditions provided by an AdGuard affiliate regarding the Affiliate Account or the Affiliate Website or the Affiliate Program shall be resolved in favor of these Terms.

### (4) Severability

If any provision of these Terms shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

### (5) No use where prohibited

Access and use of the Affiliate Account and the Affiliate Website and participation in the Affiliate Program are unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms.

You may not assign, by operation of law or otherwise, any rights or delegate any duties under these Terms to any third party without the prior written consent of AdGuard. Any purported assignment lacking such consent will be void at its inception. AdGuard may assign all or part of its rights and/or delegate all or part of its duties under these Terms to any party, at any time, and in its sole discretion, upon notice of assignment by publishing such notice on the Affiliate Website.

### (7) Period for bringing actions
