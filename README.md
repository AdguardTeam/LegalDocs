# Legal Documents

This repository contains AdGuardâ€™s legal documents, they are later synced to the
website. The purpose is to be transparent about the history of their changes.

The file names and directories structure explain where the files should be
located on the server. For instance, `./adguard.com/eula.html.md` corresponds
to `https://adguard.com/eula.html`.

Translations need to be done internally and are not stored in this repo.
On the website we must indicate that the document was translated and point to
the original version in English language.
